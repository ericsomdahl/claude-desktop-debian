## üõ†Ô∏è Building & Installation

For Debian-based distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS, etc.), you can build Claude Desktop using our automated build script. The script supports multiple output formats and architectures.

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/ericsomdahl/claude-desktop-debian.git
cd claude-desktop-debian

# Build the package (Defaults to .deb and cleans build files)
./build.sh

# Example: Build an AppImage and keep intermediate files
./build.sh --build appimage --clean no

# Example: Build a .deb (explicitly) and clean intermediate files (default)
./build.sh --build deb --clean yes
```

The script will automatically:
 - Check for and install required dependencies
 - Download and extract resources from the Windows version
 - Create a proper Debian package or AppImage
 - Perform the build steps based on selected flags

## üìã After Building

### If you chose Debian Package (.deb):

The script will output the path to the generated `.deb` file (e.g., `claude-desktop_0.9.3_amd64.deb`). Install it using `dpkg`:

```bash
# Replace VERSION and ARCHITECTURE with the actual values from the filename
sudo dpkg -i ./claude-desktop_VERSION_ARCHITECTURE.deb 

# If you encounter dependency issues, run:
sudo apt --fix-broken install 
```

### If you chose AppImage (.AppImage):

The script will output the path to the generated `.AppImage` file (e.g., `claude-desktop-0.9.3-amd64.AppImage`) and a corresponding `.desktop` file (`claude-desktop-appimage.desktop`).

**AppImage login will not work unless you setup the .desktop file correctly or use a tool like AppImageLauncher to manage it for you.**

1.  **Make the AppImage executable:**
    ```bash
    # Replace FILENAME with the actual AppImage filename
    chmod +x ./FILENAME.AppImage 
    ```
2.  **Run the AppImage:**
    ```bash
    ./FILENAME.AppImage
    ```
3.  **(Optional) Integrate with your system:**
    -   Tools like [AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher) can automatically integrate AppImages (moving them to a central location and adding them to your application menu) using the bundled `.desktop` file.
    -   Alternatively, you can manually move the `.AppImage` file to a preferred location (e.g., `~/Applications` or `/opt`) and copy the generated `claude-desktop-appimage.desktop` file to `~/.local/share/applications/` (you might need to edit the `Exec=` line in the `.desktop` file to point to the new location of the AppImage).

#### --no-sandbox

The AppImage script runs with electron's --no-sandbox flag. AppImage's don't have their own sandbox. chome-sandbox, which is used by electron, needs to escalate root privileges briefly in order to setup the sandbox. When you pack an AppImage, chrome-sandbox loses any assigned ownership and executes with user permissions. There's also an issue with [unprivileged namespaces](https://www.reddit.com/r/debian/comments/hkyeft/comment/fww5xb1) being set differently on different distributions.

**Alternatives to --no-sandbox**
 - Run claude-desktop as root
   - Doesn't feel warm and fuzzy.
 - Install chrome-sandbox outside of the AppImage(or leverage an existing install), set it with the right permissions, and reference it.
   - Counter-intuitive to the "batteries included" mindset of AppImages
 - Run it with --no-sandbox, but then wrap the whole thing inside another sandbox like bubblewrap
   - Not "batteries included", and configuring in such a way that it runs everywhere is beyond my immediate capabilities.

I'd love a better suggestion. Feel free to submit a PR or start a discussion if I missed something obvious.

## üóëÔ∏è Uninstallation

### Debian Package (.deb)

If you installed the `.deb` package, you can uninstall it using `dpkg`:

```bash
sudo dpkg -r claude-desktop
```

If you also want to remove configuration files (including MCP settings), use `purge`:

```bash
sudo dpkg -P claude-desktop
```

### AppImage (.AppImage)

If you used the AppImage:
1.  Delete the `.AppImage` file.
2.  Delete the associated `.desktop` file (e.g., `claude-desktop-appimage.desktop` from where you placed it, like `~/.local/share/applications/`).
3.  If you used AppImageLauncher, it might offer an option to un-integrate the AppImage.

### Configuration Files (Both Formats)

To remove user-specific configuration files (including MCP settings), regardless of installation method:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/Claude
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

Aside from the install logs, runtime logs can be found in (`$HOME/claude-desktop-launcher.log`).

If your window isn't scaling correctly the first time or two you open the application, right click on the claude-desktop panel (taskbar) icon and quit. When doing a safe shutdown like this, the application saves some states to the .config/claude folder which will resolve the issue moving forward. Force quitting the application will not trigger the updates. 

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works (Debian/Ubuntu Build)

Claude Desktop is an Electron application packaged as a Windows executable. Our build script performs several key operations to make it work on Linux:

1.  Downloads and extracts the Windows installer
2.  Unpacks the `app.asar` archive containing the application code
3.  Replaces the Windows-specific native module with a Linux-compatible stub implementation
4.  Repackages everything into the user's chosen format:
    *   **Debian Package (.deb):** Creates a standard Debian package installable via `dpkg`.
    *   **AppImage (.AppImage):** Creates a self-contained executable using `appimagetool`.

The process works because Claude Desktop is largely cross-platform, with only one platform-specific component that needs replacement.

### Build Process Details

The main build script (`build.sh`) orchestrates the process:

1. Checks for a Debian-based system and required dependencies
2. Parses command-line flags (`--build`, `--clean`) to determine output format and cleanup behavior.
3. Downloads the official Windows installer
4. Extracts the application resources
5. Processes icons for Linux desktop integration
6. Unpacks and modifies the app.asar:
   - Replaces the native mapping module with our Linux version
   - Preserves all other functionality
7. Calls the appropriate packaging script (`scripts/build-deb-package.sh` or `scripts/build-appimage.sh`) to create the final output:
   *   **For .deb:** Creates a package with desktop entry, icons, dependencies, and post-install steps.
   *   **For .AppImage:** Creates an AppDir, bundles Electron, generates an `AppRun` script and `.desktop` file, and uses `appimagetool` to create the final `.AppImage`.

### Automated Version Detection

The repository includes an automated system (`scripts/check-upstream-version.py`) that:

- Monitors both amd64 and arm64 Claude Desktop installers daily
- Downloads only small chunks (2MB) to efficiently extract version information
- Uses multiple regex patterns to detect version numbers in binary data
- Tracks file metadata (ETag, size, last-modified) for reliable change detection
- Automatically triggers builds when new versions are detected
- Creates GitHub issues and releases to notify users of updates

See [`AUTOMATION.md`](AUTOMATION.md) for detailed information about the automation system.
